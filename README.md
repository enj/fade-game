#### Instructions

The goal of the game is to traverse the three levels of the maze and escape to the outside.  Each level has a locked door at its exit.  You must find a randomly placed key to unlock it.  The darkness is your enemy.  At the start of the game you start with one torch which gives you a minute of light.  You die if you run out of light.  Every level has a randomly placed torch to help you survive.  You will restart at the current level with a single torch's worth of light upon death.  The torch meter on the top right of the screen shows how much light you have left.  You can hold up to three torches.  The amount of light you have directly determines how far you can see around you.  The distance you can see steadily decreases as the light runs out.

- Move using the arrow keys
- Collect torches and keys by walking over them
